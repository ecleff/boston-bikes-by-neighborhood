      Biker Profiles by Neighborhood: Boston
    </h1>
    <div class='main-text'>
      For those brave enough to share the Boston roadways with its frighteningly chaotic drivers, biking is a great way to zip around the city.
      This project explores and compares trip characteristics between bikers using BlueBikes coming from Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville.
      <p>
        The first plot displays trips along parallel coordinates, starting from the time a trip starts, to how long the trip takes, to what time it ends, and finally, if it ended up in the same district that it started in.
        Trips that end in the same district as their origin end on top, while the trips that end in a different district end on the bottom.
    
      </p>
      <p>
        The second plot represents the distribution of trips by their duration. Trip duration was capped at 70 minutes for scale purposes (there were few but extreme outliers).
      </p>
        <p>
        This project uses a representative sample of BlueBikes trips (500 trips) during October 2022 from the <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data"> BlueBikes System Data portal </a>.
