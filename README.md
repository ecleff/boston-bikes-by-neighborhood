# boston-bikes-by-neighborhood

This project explores and compares trip characteristics between bikers using BlueBikes coming from Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville. Users can choose a neighborhood of origin and observe trips from their start, their duration, to what time the trip ends, and finally, if it ended up in the same district that it started in. Users can also see the distribution of trips by their duration for the selected neighborhood. Trip duration was capped at 70 minutes for scale purposes (there were few but extreme outliers). This project was built using VegaLite.js.

This project uses a representative sample of BlueBikes trips (500 trips) during October 2022 from the BlueBikes System Data portal.
